# Welcome to my handy GM Helper (Web Edition).  
## Current features:
 - Initiative list sorting
 - Turn tracking 
 - Monster HP tracking area
 - Simple Dice Roller
 - Status Effect tracking for players and monsters

### BASIC USE 

While I designed this to maximize it's ease of use, documentation is always a good thing.  You can enter your players and their initiatives in the left column and the monsters and their initiatives in the right column.  Click "Start Combat" and the "Initiative List" will be populated based on the data entered.  In the event of initiative ties, players are given priority over monsters and randomly ordered if the same.  If you want to easily clear either the player or monster list, you can click the approptiate "Clear X" button to do just that.

The HP fields can be used to track HP.  Simply click in the field to edit it. 

The checkboxes can be used to remove a monster from the initiative list, however, it should be noted that unchecking does not reinstate that monster back into combat.  That functionality is planned for a future update.  I also plan to have monsters 'hidden' so they can be secretly added to the initiative list, but that will be in the Map (see below) update most likely.

The Status Effect Creator can be used to give your players or monsters a buff/debuff and on thier turn it will be listed in the "X is effected by:" area.
